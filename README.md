# Setup

### Weâ€™ll be using Vite to handle bundling our app and providing a dev server. You can quickly scaffold a new app using their CLI:

1. npm init @vitejs/app
   Follow the instructions in your Terminal (pick the react option)
2. cd [my-app-name]
3. npm install to install the dependencies
4. npm run dev start the dev server
